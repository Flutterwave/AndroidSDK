## Before you begin
- [Create your Rave staging keys from the sandbox environment](https://flutterwavedevelopers.readme.io/blog/how-to-get-your-staging-keys-from-the-rave-sandbox-environment)
- [Create your Rave live keys from the Rave Dashboard](https://flutterwavedevelopers.readme.io/blog/how-to-get-your-live-keys-from-the-rave-dashboard)

## Requirements


The minimum supported SDK version is 15

## Adding it to your project


**Step 1.** Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

    allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}

**Step 2.** Add the dependency

    dependencies {
	     implementation 'com.github.Flutterwave:rave-android:1.0.32'
	}

**Step 3.** Add the required permission

Add the `READ_PHONE_PERMISSION` and `INTERNET` permissions to your android manifest

     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
     <uses-permission android:name="android.Manifest.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

> **REQUIRED PERMISSION**
> This library requires the **READ_PHONE_PERMISSION** to get the build number for fraud detection and flagging as recommended here https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids.html#i_abuse_detection_detecting_high_value_stolen_credentials

## Usage

###  1. Create a `RavePayManager` instance
Set the public key, encryption key and other required parameters. The `RavePayManager` accepts a mandatory instance of  the calling `Activity`

        new RavePayManager(activity).setAmount(amount)
                        .setCountry(country)
                        .setCurrency(currency)

                        .setTxRef(txRef)
                        .acceptAccountPayments(boolean)
                        .acceptCardPayments(boolean)
                        .acceptMpesaPayments(boolean)
                        .acceptAchPayments(boolean)
                        .acceptGHMobileMoneyPayments(boolean)
			    .acceptUgMobileMoneyPayments(boolean)
                        .onStagingEnv(boolean)
                        .allowSaveCardFeature(boolean)
                        .setMeta(List<Meta>)
                        .withTheme(styleId)
                        .isPreAuth(boolean)
                        .setSubAccounts(List<SubAccount>)
                        .shouldDisplayFee(boolean)
                        .initialize();

###  2. Handle the response
In the calling activity, override the `onActivityResult` method to receive the payment response as shown below

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        /*
         *  We advise you to do a further verification of transaction's details on your server to be
         *  sure everything checks out before providing service or goods.
        */
        if (requestCode == RaveConstants.RAVE_REQUEST_CODE && data != null) {
            String message = data.getStringExtra("response");
            if (resultCode == RavePayActivity.RESULT_SUCCESS) {
                Toast.makeText(this, "SUCCESS " + message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
            else if (resultCode == RavePayActivity.RESULT_ERROR) {
                Toast.makeText(this, "ERROR " + message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
            else if (resultCode == RavePayActivity.RESULT_CANCELLED) {
                Toast.makeText(this, "CANCELLED " + message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        }
        else {
            super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        }
    }
The intent's `message` object contains the raw JSON response from the Rave API. This can be parsed to retrieve any additional payment information needed.

> **PLEASE NOTE**
>  We advise you to do a further verification of transaction's details on your server to be
 sure everything checks out before providing service or goods.
